<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What feature did you pick? Briefly explain how you implemented it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The first feature I picked was the number guesser. The first thing I<br>did to implement this was create two variables that would track if the<br>game was active and what the correct number would be. I created a<br>new ProcessGameCommand method that handled everything for the game, including when the game<br>should be started and stopped, tracking the guesses and users who guessed it,<br>and defining the bounds and the correct number. That was the major chunk<br>of the feature the only other things I did were adjust the broadcast<br>method to handle the ProcessGameCommand and then added some code on the client<br>side to send the commands to the server<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The second feature I picked was the coin tosser/flipper. Implementing this was almost<br>the same as the number guesser. I used a processCoinToss method that was<br>fairly short that would give a heads or tails if the user typed<br>either the toss or flip. The only other thing I did was add<br>the method to the broadcast method and made sure the commands were recognized<br>on the client side.<br></p><br></td></tr>

After asking Professor Toegel about it I learned<br>that I was running program wrong wasn&#39;t using the Package.class reference when I<br>was running which is why I was getting that error<br></p><br></td></tr>
